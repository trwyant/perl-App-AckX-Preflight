This Perl script prints to standard out the file that is presented on
its standard in, with lines numbered consistently with the usage in
F<t/syntax_*.t>. It must be run from the home directory of this package,
because it makes use of C<My::Module::TestSyntax>, which is in the
F<inc/> directory of the package.

This Perl script is completely unsupported, and may be changed or
removed without notice.
