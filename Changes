    Add syntax filters for:
    - Fortran
    - Makefile
    - JSON
    - Vimscript
    - YAML

    Rename ::Syntax::Java to ::Cpp The old module is still around, but
    IN_SERVICE returns false.

    Keep ::Plugin::File from wrongly using --literal.

    Add syntax filters for C and SQL.

    Add C++ ('cpp') as a file type for the Java syntax filter.

    Add .t ('perltest') as a file type for the Perl syntax filter. It
    may be redundant, but it is also relevant.

    Make file types processed by syntax filters configurable.
    This is done with command-line options analogous to file type
    definition, to wit:
	--syntax-add=Filter:file-type...
	    adds the file types to the filter;
	--syntax-del=Filter:file-type...
	    removes the file types from the filter;
	--syntax-set=Filter:file-type...
	    replaces all file types for the filter
    The Filter argument is for App::AckX::Preflight::Syntax, and is omitted
    if called directly on the filter.

    Add --verbose to App::AckX::Preflight->run().  At the moment this
    writes the generated command to standard error.  But the
    documentation makes no commitments.

    Replace PerlFile plugin with generic Syntax plugin, supported by
    PerlIO::via classes for each implemented language.  The idea is that
    the kinds of things that get looked for are generic: code, comments,
    documentation, data, and (potentially) other.

    This was a fairly significant change that included:
    - Ditching ::via::PerlFile in favor of ::Syntax::Perl
    - Adding ::Syntax::Java and ::Syntax::Shell, more or less to
      sanity-test the system.

    Add the PerlFile plugin. This supports options -perl-code and
    -perl-pod, which causes only those portions of a Perl file to be
    searched. This is accomplished by having a PerlIO::via object filter
    out the unwanted lines. I had to hot-patch the App::Ack::Resource
    open() method to get this loaded.

    Handle inverted types (e.g. --noperl).

    Recognize -x as synonym of --files-from

    Bump Getopt::Long requirement to 2.39.  This is needed to get
    Getopt::Long::Parser->getoptionsfromarray().

    Remove Manifest plug-in. This was superseded by FilesFrom.

    Add run() options --disable, --enable. These either disable or
    enable plug-ins. Plug-in name may be given either with or without
    the 'App::AckX::Preflight::Plugin::' prefix. You can not specify an
    unknown plugin, and --enable will not enable an unavailable plugin.

    Move _file_id() to ::Util (as __file_id()). This because I thought I
    saw another use for it, though I may be wrong.

    Add --relative for plugin ::FilesFrom.  This causes names relative
    to the location of the file to be made relative to the current
    directory.

    Disable ::FilesFrom MANIFEST funct on --nomanifest. That is,
    something like
      ackxp --nomanifest --files-from MANIFEST -w Fubar
    causes the MANIFEST file to be read directly, instead of via
    ExtUtils::Manifest::maniread().

    Make File plugin syntax more like grep.

    Support --literal/-Q in File plugin.

    Add plugin FilesFrom, which supersedes Manifest.

    Add plug-in IN_SERVICE manifest constant. This is actually used as a
    method, and is set false by the plug-in's author to take the plug-in
    out of service when it is to be replaced by a plug-in having a
    different name.

    Add Util:: __err_exclusive() for exclusive options. This takes the
    names of the two (and only two!) exclusive options, and calls
    __die() with an appropriate message.

    Add --ack-filters, so they can be disabled using --no-ack-filters.
    This defaults to __filter_available(). Its anticipated use is to
    bypass this functionality if it turns out to be broken.

    Use actual argument parsing for filter set-up. The previous code
    hand-rummaged through @ARGV.

    Also make ::Util::__getopt() use getoptionsfromarray(), with a reference
    to an array being the optional first argument. This saves at least some
    of the localization of @ARGV. Whether that's worth doing I don't know,
    but I did it.

    Process type definitions on the command line.

    Add eg/README, mv eg/ACKX{,P}-REF

0.000_002	2018-03-14	T. R. Wyant
    Add --help, with optional arguments: 'config' for config sources;
    'plugins' to list plugins, and plugin name for help on that plugin.

    Move option processing code to ::Util.

    Add plug-in method __peek_opt(). This is like __options(), but any
    options found are NOT removed from @ARGV.

    Add the Manifest plug-in, which searches the files found in the
    MANIFEST file. This supports type processing if it is available.

    Add App::AckX::Preflight methods __filter_available() and
    __filter_files(). The former returns a Boolean true if
    App::Ack-style file filtering is available to plugins, and false if
    not. The latter actually filters a list of input files, returning
    those that match. If filtering is not available, __filter_files()
    just returns its arguments.

    Go to object-oriented calls for plugin methods. Provide a plugin
    superclass, but this is not needed as long as the plugin conforms to
    the interface.

    Ensure script/ackxp is installed.

    Subclass App::AckX::Preflight for testing, as an alternative to
    hammering varous subroutines.

    Consider all instances of --env/--noenv, not just '--noenv' itself.

    Move common code to ::Util

    Add support for configuration files. These are modeled after ack's,
    but the names are variants on 'ackxprc'.

    Martial plugins based on the last (right-most) relevant option, not
    the first. Also consider negated options.
