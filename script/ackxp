=head1 TITLE

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 ackxp -w foo
 ackxp -help
 ackxp -version

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 -help

This option displays the documentation for this script. The script then
exits.

=head2 -version

This option displays the version of this script. The script then exits.

=head1 DETAILS

This Perl script simply loads
L<App::AckX::Preflight|App::AckX::Preflight> and calls its
L<run()|App::AckX::Preflight/run> method. This method loads whatever
plugins are installed, and calls them to modify the command arguments as
they see fit. Then it passes control to the F<ack> script.

No, none of this makes F<ack> do anything it would not have done before.
But it can come close. A plug-in could do something like load patterns
from a file, or restrict the search to files whose names appear in a
F<MANIFEST>. At this level it's really an exercise in imagination.
